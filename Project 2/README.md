# ClassificationThis project is the Homework2 of DATA130003Codes are implemented by **MATLAB**## IntroductionIn this project, students are required to explore both the theories and implementation processes of some classification methods, which include:1. Logistic Regression   *  Bayesâ€™ Rule    *  Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)    *  L2 Regularization2. Digit Classification    *  k-Nearest Neighbours    *  Logistic regression    *  Penalized logistic regression    *  Naive Bayes    *  Compare k-NN, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes3.  Stochastic Subgradient Methods (SVM)   *  Averaging and Step-size Strategies(Detailed task information could be obtained in the Requirement.pdf)## RemarkIf you have any question, please don't hesitate to contact 1336076538@qq.com for help.
