# Neural NetworkThis project is the Homework3 of DATA130003Codes are implemented by **MATLAB**## IntroductionIn this project, students are required to manually construct Neural Network with MATLAB to implement the classification task on the MINIST dataset, and try to utilize different tricks to modify  the Neural Network:1. Changing the structure of Neural Network2. Variable weights3. Weight update4. Regularization5. Regularization 6. Add bias to the hidden layer7. Dropout8.  Fine-tuning9. Add Artificial data10. **CNN**(Detailed task information could be obtained in the Requirement.pdf)## RemarkIf you have any question, please don't hesitate to contact 1336076538@qq.com for help.
